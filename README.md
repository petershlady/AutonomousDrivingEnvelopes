# AutonomousDrivingEnvelopes

This is a MATLAB implementation of [Safe driving envelopes for path tracking in autonomous vehicles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967066116300831).

## Prerequisites

```
MATLAB
CVX
```
When this was tested with [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) for MATLAB on Windows 10, it was necessary to use the SeDuMi solver. On MacOS, the default SDPT3 solver worker fine. Try them both.
